This webpage is like an online resume or personal showcase for someone learning web development.

At the top, there's a main heading with the person's name and a simple menu to jump to different sections.

The introduction says who they are and what the site is about.

The "About Me" section has their photo and a little about their interest in web development.

"My Projects" lists some things they've built, like their portfolio site, a blog that looks like Medium, a birthday card page, and a contact form.

There's a special birthday card section with a friendly message.

The Medium Clone section shows two sample blog posts with titles and short dates.

Their technical skills are shown in a simple table listing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript levels.

At the bottom, a contact form lets visitors send them messages.

The main purpose is to introduce the person, show off their skills and projects, and let people get in touch. It's built using very basic HTML elements, so it's a perfect practice project for someone starting web development. The structure helps visitors quickly find info and guides them through who the person is and what they've done.
